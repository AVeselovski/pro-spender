# Spendly App

App for tracking monthly spending. Organize your spending by categories, assign budgets to categories and see if the budgets hold. Get true monthly averages and make monthly adjustments to your budgets (or spending habits) to hit consistency.

Future features:

1. Graphs and statistics to help visualize spending patterns.
2. "Insights". Generated based on available data (e.g. "Category X overflows 2nd time this year, consider adjusting the budget or your spending")

## Tech

So far a basic React-Redux app with MUI. Backend details still open.
